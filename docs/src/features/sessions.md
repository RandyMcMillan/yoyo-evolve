# Session Persistence

yoyo can save and load conversations, letting you resume where you left off.

## Auto-save on exit

yoyo **automatically saves your conversation** to `.yoyo/last-session.json` every time you exit the REPL — whether via `/quit`, `/exit`, `Ctrl-D`, or even unexpected termination. No flags needed.

If a previous session is detected on startup, yoyo prints a hint:

```
  💡 Previous session found. Use --continue or /load .yoyo/last-session.json to resume.
```

## Resuming with --continue

The `--continue` (or `-c`) flag restores the last auto-saved session:

```bash
yoyo --continue
yoyo -c
```

`--continue-strict` behaves like `--continue`, but if the session file is missing or can't be parsed it prints `error: --continue-strict: could not restore <path>: <reason>` and exits 1 **before any model call**. Plain `--continue` only warns and starts a fresh conversation (exit 0), so scripts that need to know a run really continued should use the strict flag. With `--output-format stream-json`, a successful restore also emits `{"type":"sessionRestored","messages":N}` as the line right after the first `agentStart`. It is absent when nothing was restored (see [piped mode](../usage/piped-mode.md)).

`--save-session <path>` makes a non-interactive run (`-p` or piped stdin) write its session to `<path>` when it finishes — even if the turn failed — in the same format `/save` uses, so `/load <path>` resumes it. The parent directory must already exist; if the write fails yoyo prints `error: --save-session: could not write <path>: <reason>` and exits non-zero.

When `--continue` is used:
1. **On startup**, yoyo loads from `.yoyo/last-session.json` (preferred) or `yoyo-session.json` (legacy fallback)
2. **On exit**, the conversation is auto-saved as usual

```bash
$ yoyo -c
  📋 resumed session (8 messages, 5 tool calls)
  last prompt: "Can you fix the test failures in commands_map.rs?"
  last reply:  "I found 3 failing tests. The issue was..."

main > what were we working on?
```

## Manual save/load

**Save the current conversation:**
```
/save
```
This writes to `yoyo-session.json` in the current directory.

**Save to a custom path:**
```
/save my-session.json
```

**Load a conversation:**
```
/load
/load my-session.json
/load .yoyo/last-session.json
```

## Session format

Sessions are stored as JSON files containing the conversation message history. The format is determined by the yoagent library.

### The `/todo` list travels with the session

The `/todo` list is session state, so it is saved and restored with the conversation. Every save path (`/save`, auto-save on exit, `--save-session`) writes the list to a sibling file named after the session with a `.todos.json` extension: `.yoyo/last-session.json` gets `.yoyo/last-session.todos.json`, and `yoyo-session.json` gets `yoyo-session.todos.json`. Every resume path (`/load`, `--continue`) reads it back, with the same IDs, descriptions and statuses.

- Loading a session **replaces** the current list. A session saved before this existed, or saved with an empty list, has no sibling file and resumes with an empty list.
- Saving with an empty list writes no sibling file and removes a stale one left at the same path, so old items can't come back.
- If the sibling file can't be read or parsed, the resume still succeeds: yoyo prints one warning on stderr and starts with an empty list.
- `/todo board` tasks are files under `session_plan/` and are not part of this; only the session list is.

## Error handling

- If no previous session exists when using `--continue`, yoyo prints a message and starts fresh
- If a session file is corrupt or can't be parsed, yoyo warns you and starts fresh
- Empty conversations (no messages exchanged) are not auto-saved
- Save errors are reported but don't crash yoyo
